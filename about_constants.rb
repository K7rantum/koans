  # QUESTION: Now which has precedence: The constant in the lexical
  # scope, or the constant from the inheritance hierarchy?  Why is it
  # different than the previous answer?
  #
  # ANSWER:
  # In this case it is inheritance that has the precendence. Sine we explicitly define that
  # this new class Oystor, a sub-class of MyAnimals, is derived from the main class Animal...
  # It all filters down from the Animal class where it is derived from, which has 4 LEGS.
